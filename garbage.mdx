# Alert Modal
A modal that **interrupts** the user's workflow to provide important information and **aquire a response**.

<Notes>

- Similar to the alert component, but this time we require our user to interact with it.
- A terms and conditions popup or a paywall on the nytimes asking you to subscribe.

## TL;DR [Alert Modal](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20190814/#alertdialog)
- Container element has `role="alertdialog"`
- Container title is specified using properties `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label`
- Container element has `aria-describedby` to designate the alert message element.
- When the modal opens focus moves to an element inside the the alert modal.
- `tab` and `shift+tab` move focus from one element to another inside the modal.
- `esc` closes the modal.

```jsx
const AlertModal = ({ 
  alertTitle='',
  alertMessage='',
  closeHanlder,
  closeText 
}) => (
  <div className="modal">
    <h2>{alertTitle}</h2>
    <p>{alertMessage}</p>
    <button onClick={closeHanlder}>{closeText}</button>
  </div>
)
```

- start off with the markup.  a div as the container.
- paragraph with dynamic message passed in via a prop
- and our interactive element for the user to respond to the alert.

  <div 
    className="modal"
    role="alertdialog"
    aria-labelledby="alertTitle"
    aria-describedby="alertMessage">
    <h2 id="alertTitle">{alertTitle}</h2>
    <p id="alertMessage">{alertMessage}</p>
    <button onClick={closeHanlder}>{closeText}</button>
  </div>
)

<Notes>

- We have to add a few ARIA attributes.
- we need to give our container a label.  Let's use `aria-labelledby` to do that.
- this let's us identify another element that will be the label for the modal.  In this case it's our h2 with the matching id attribute
- we also need to identify the message for our container using `aria-describedby`.  Similarly we'll pass the value of the id on the paragraph element that is our message.
